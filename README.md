## This fork is focusing on making the menu completely modular via implementing a handler system that passes menu items to NUI each time the menu is requested.


# Captains-ContextMenu-FiveM
### About <br/>
A Raytrace & Entity based context menu for GTA V FiveM.
<br/>
Perform actions based off the Entity you are interacting with in the world. Such as Vehicles, ATMs, Phonebooths, Trashcans, Doors, Cashregisters and all other Entities that the game offers. <br/>
<br/>
**NOTE:** This is a context menu Shell meaning features such as the Police menu are just an Empty menu buttons that do nothing but they are setup in such a way that you can easily add calls to them such as Exports to actual Police related scripts. It's there as an Example on how **YOU** can add your own actions to it. It is a system to be build on and have it work how **YOU** want it to.<br/>
**READ THE HOW TO MODIFY AT THE BOTTOM**
<br/>

### How to Install
- Clone or Download the contextmenu and hashtomenu folders.
- Drop the two folders in your FiveM Server Resources folder.
- Add the Resources to your FiveM server.cfg file. (To be safe start the hashtoname resource BEFORE the contextmenu)
<br/>

### How to Modify
In the code itself i've written comments on how everything works and how **YOU** can add your own functionality to the resource. <br/>
The code contains Examples on how you can implement your own options as well as some features, such as the Doors menu which is fully operational. <br/>
Every action (button) in the menu leads to somewhere. Meaning you can easily add the code you want and the actions you want to happen when X button on the menu is pressed.
